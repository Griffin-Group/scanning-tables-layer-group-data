This repository contains the data and code for the paper "Symmetries of all lines in monolayer crystals" by Bernard Field and Sinéad M. Griffin.
Specifically, these are scanning tables, which tabulate the symmetry of every crystallographic penetration line passing through every layer group (the symmetry group of monolayer crystals/2D materials).
This repository also contains a few incidental functions useful for processing crystallographic symmetry groups.

If you use the data or code in a publication, please cite:

The paper is also openly available at [arXiv:2410.18750](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18750).

## Layout

The scanning tables are available in PDF format in `tex/tables.pdf` and in JSON format in `TableData/LayerScanningTablesProcessed.json`.

### `figures`

Contains visualisations of the data in the table.
Some of these figures were used in the paper.

### `gap`

GAP scripts and functions used to generate the scanning tables.
`Identify_Group.gap` and `RepresentativeSymmetryOps.gap` have broad applications for processing crystallographic groups and identifying layer and rod groups.
`FindOrigin.gap` also has broad applications for layer and rod groups, although its scope is more restricted.
`Scanning.gap` contains functions specific to generating the scanning tables.
The `tst/` directory contains unit tests for these functions, if you want to test your installation.
`Make*.gap` create the data files.
`MakeAllScanningTables.gap` takes about 10 minutes to run on a personal computer.

### `TableData`

Data generated by GAP scripts for the tables, and scripts to process it into a usable format.
`make_all.sh` runs the processing scripts, generating the final data files `LayerScanningTablesProcessed.json` and `LayerScanningTables.tex`.
The `README` details the format of the JSON files.

### `tex`

Compiles the LaTeX version of the tables.
See `paper.pdf` for the tables.

### `SubperiodicGroupData`

Auxiliary data, used so Cryst would have access to a database of the rod, layer, and frieze groups.
The generators `*_nosetting.gi` were obtained from the [Bilbao Crystallographic Server](https://www.cryst.ehu.es/), with some formatting to put it into a GAP format.
The different settings were generated using `MakeSettings.gap`, using transformation matrices read from the Bilbao Crystallographic Server.
The data files were combined using `MakeSubgrp.pl` to make `subgrp.grp`, which is a complete GAP source file.
`subgrp.grp` is the database of subperiodic groups used in my [patched version of Cryst](https://github.com/bfield1/cryst/tree/subperiodic).

## Dependencies

This project uses [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/), a system for computational discrete algebra with a focus on groups.
It makes substantial use of the [Cryst](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~gaehler/gap/packages.php) package.
It specifically uses a version of Cryst patched by Bernard Field to extend functionality of subperiodic groups (https://github.com/bfield1/cryst/tree/subperiodic).
You need that patch to run any of the code here.
The patch may get merged upstream in future, although that is beyond our control.

The plots in `figures` require the Python package Plotly to generate.
